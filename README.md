# calculator
Basic calculator application
44 functioning tests
Uses only the minus sign for subtraction and negative numbers
Rounds results of operations to fit on screen and if number is too large, will use scientific notation
Divide by 0 error sometimes is resized correctly but not always. Would troubleshoot further but difficult to reproduce error and need to move on to other projects
